    "1. ***version control***: Git tracks changes to code over time, allowing for visibility into what changes were made, when, and by whom.\n",
    "2. ***distributed***: Unlike centralized systems, where there's one main server storing the project, Git allows every contributor to have a full copy of the project (including its history) on their own machine.\n",
    "3. ***branching***: Git allows the creation of branches, which are separate versions of the project to work on features or fixes without affecting the main project.\n",
    "4. ***merging***: Once work on a branch is complete, Git makes it easy to merge changes back into the main version of the project.\n",
    "5. ***collaboration***: Git allows multiple contributors to work on the same project without overwriting each other's work, thanks to branching and merging capabilities."
